## Module 11 Challenge

## About
This challenge is to demonstrate the use of MongoDB and analyze data within an updated database. Specifically the "storyline" is that I have been hired by editors of a food manazine to evaluate food hygiene ratings data for food establishments in the UK as a tool for journalists and food critics.

The requirements are as follows:

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up

Part 2: Update the Database

Part 3: Exploratory Analysis

## Process and Resources
### Timeline
0722 Created repository, cloned locally, added and commited starter files.

0724 Set up README format, completed Part 1 and most of Part 2

### Links used:


## Examples
Import the dataset with `mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json`
